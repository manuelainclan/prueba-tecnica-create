# CREATE Technical Test || HTML and CSS (english)

Hi there! My name is Manuela Inclán and I created this project based on a design provided by CREATE to demonstrate my knowledge.. The website is responsive and built using **flex** 🎨💻.

You can see it live here! 👉 [CREATE_technical_test]( https://manuelainclan.github.io/prueba-tecnica-create/)

I hope you like it! 😊

## This exercise shows that I can handle and control the following 📋:

### General

- Use an appropriate file and folder structure for a web project and correctly link different files.

### **HTML**

- Write perfectly indented HTML code.
- Create well-structured HTML code with correct syntax.
- Use appropriate **semantic** HTML tags for each piece of content.

### **CSS / Sass**

- Write perfectly indented CSS code.
- Create well-structured Sass code with correct syntax.
- Use Sass features such as **variables**, **nesting**, and **partials**.
- Use CSS code that uses **class selectors**, not tag or ID selectors.
- Use class selectors in English.
- Use the CSS **box model** appropriately to specify size, padding, and margins.
- Use **text and background styles** for different types of elements.
- Use **flexbox** appropriately to arrange elements in flexible boxes.
- Use **media queries** to adjust designs to different device sizes.
- Use **positioning** to place fixed and absolute elements on the screen.
- Use CSS **transitions** to add dynamism to a web project.

### Additionally, I focused on using:

- **Mixins** 🍹
- **Variables** 💻
- **BEM**

### I would have liked to:

- Use some **animation**.
- **Optimize** shared classes and styles between elements more.
- Give it some **unique styles** or follow the CREATE page style.
- Choose more **descriptive classes** for the content.
- Use **grid** in some section.

### Built with 🔨

- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- HTML
- SASS
- GULP

## Development ⌨️

To carry out this project, I followed the guidelines set by the given design.
I sketched out a diagram with pencil and paper to organize myself effectively. This allowed me to think about the best way to divide the project into partials.
I started the design with a Mobile First approach and then added the necessary mediaqueries to make the design adapt to different devices.
I used SASS to style the project; I really like its nesting capabilities as it allows me to work in a more organized and efficient manner.

## Want to clone my repository? 🐑🐑

Remember that this repository was done using the [Adalab Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit) so I highly recommend to visit the link provided before running the proyect.

<sub>[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and Gulp are required <sub/>

After you clone the repository you must:

1. Install dependencies. You will only have to do this once.

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the proyect. This must be done everytime you code and will open a local host that will update in real time

```sh
npm start
```

3.  If as me, you happen to use GitHub Pages you may send your code to production using

```sh
npm run push-docs
```

<sub>PD: You will have to set your GitHub Page as master branch /docs folder.
For Gulp installing you may run

```sh
npm -g install gulp-cli
```
